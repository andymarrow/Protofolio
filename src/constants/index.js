This project was all about pushing boundaries and showing off my mad skills with the coolest technologies out there!I dove headfirst into the world of TypeScript, a language that was like a shiny new toy for me during the development process. And let me tell you, it's a game-changer! To take things up a notch, I brought in the dynamic duo of React and Next.js, making the website super snappy and interactive. And that's not all! I sprinkled some Zustand magic in there too, giving users an experience they won't be able to resist. But wait, there's more! I cranked up the excitement by tackling OAuth, a technology that was still a bit of a mystery to me. It added an extra layer of complexity, but hey, I love a challenge! And guess what? I totally nailed it! To make StudTalk a powerhouse, I supercharged the backend with Sanity. It's like the superhero of servers, effortlessly storing and managing all the important stuff—videos, likes, and juicy user comments. With this backend wizardry, StudTalk became a complete package, showcasing my mastery across the entire spectrum of modern web technologies.",
